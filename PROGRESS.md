## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Modular Slice Design
```
Engine (pure logic, deterministic)
  ‚Üì
Stores (Zustand slices)
  ‚Üì
Features (self-contained modules)
  ‚Üì
Components (reusable UI)
  ‚Üì
Pages (route views)
```

### Cross-Slice Communication
All actions funnel through `engine/api.ts`:
- `executeTrade()` - Buy/sell assets
- `executeLP()` - Provide/withdraw liquidity
- `executeOp()` - Pump/wash/audit/bribe
- `executeInfluencerAction()` - Posts, campaigns, token launch

### State Flow
```
User Action (click Buy)
  ‚Üí openBuySellModal() [TradingSlice]
  ‚Üí Modal renders with asset data [MarketSlice]
  ‚Üí User confirms
  ‚Üí executeTrade() [engine/api.ts]
  ‚Üí applyUpdates() [PlayerSlice]
  ‚Üí UI re-renders [Zustand reactivity]
```

## üìù Notes

### Development Principles
1. **Modular slices** - Each feature is self-contained
2. **Pure engine logic** - Deterministic, no side effects
3. **Type safety** - Full TypeScript coverage
4. **Reactivity** - Zustand auto-updates UI
5. **Separation of concerns** - Engine ‚Üî Stores ‚Üî UI

### Game Design
1. **Satirical** - Commentary on crypto culture
2. **Simplified realism** - Plausible but not over-complex
3. **Risk/reward** - High risk = high potential reward
4. **Progression** - Start small, build empire (or lose it all)
5. **Consequences** - Every action has scrutiny/reputation impact

### Disclaimers
- **Not financial advice**
- **Simulated market only**
- **Educational/entertainment purposes**
- **No real crypto trading**
